# Motor_Skills_Rehabilitation_Game
Developed a precision-based mouse movement game that aimed to aid motor function recovery in injured or rehabilitating users. I designed and implemented collision logic, movement constraints, and time-based challenges to simulate fine motor control situations. I used geometric boundary detection, custom animation, and event-based game state logic for responsive and interactive gameplay.
